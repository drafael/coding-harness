# Export to PNG / SVG

Convert a generated diagram HTML file into a portable `.svg` and/or `.png` next to it. **Manual only — never run unprompted.**

## Trigger

Load this file when:

- The user invokes `/diagram-design:export-diagram <html-file>` (the plugin's slash command — defined in `commands/export-diagram.md` at the repo root).
- The user asks in natural language to export, save, rasterize, convert, or download a diagram in `.svg` or `.png` form. Typical phrasings:
  - "export this as PNG"
  - "save as SVG"
  - "give me a PNG of that diagram"
  - "rasterize it"
  - "convert to png and svg"

The slash command is a thin wrapper that delegates here — both paths run the same procedure below.

## Scope

Both formats are **diagram-only** — just the `<svg>` node. Editorial wrappers (header, summary cards, footer in `-full` variants) are intentionally dropped: the export deliverable is the diagram itself, suitable for Figma, slides, social cards, or blog images.

The SVG-only export keeps the source `<title>` and `<desc>` with the diagram. Their per-diagram and per-variant prefixed IDs are what make multiple exported SVGs safe to inline in the same page without one figure resolving to another figure's accessible name.

If the user explicitly asks for "a screenshot of the whole page including the cards", that's a different request — fall back to a normal full-page screenshot via the user's OS or browser.

## SVG export procedure

1. Read the source HTML file.
2. Extract the **first** `<svg ...>...</svg>` block. Use a multiline regex anchored on `<svg` and `</svg>`. Most generated diagrams have only one SVG; if there are multiple, the first is the diagram (gallery files are an exception — see *Edge cases*).
3. Make it standalone:
   - Ensure the opening tag has `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`. Add it if missing.
   - Ensure a `viewBox` is present. The skill's templates always include one; warn the user if absent rather than guessing.
   - Preserve `role="img"`, `aria-labelledby`, and the first-child `<title>` / `<desc>` exactly as authored.
   - Inject Google Fonts `@import` so the SVG renders with correct typography in a browser. **XML-escape the `&` separators as `&amp;`** — a standalone `.svg` is parsed as strict XML, where a bare `&` starts an entity reference and makes the whole file fail to parse. (Don't copy the raw URL from the HTML `<link href>`; that ampersand form is only valid in HTML.)
     ```svg
     <defs>
       <style>@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Instrument+Serif:ital@0;1&amp;family=Geist:wght@400;500;600&amp;family=Geist+Mono:wght@400;500;600&amp;display=swap');</style>
     </defs>
     ```
     If the SVG already contains a `<defs>` block, **merge** the `<style>` into it (don't add a second `<defs>`).
4. Prepend `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n` so the file is well-formed XML.
5. Write to `<basename>.svg` next to the source (e.g. `example-architecture.html` → `example-architecture.svg`). Honour an explicit output path if the user provides one.

### Caveat to surface to the user

Tools that don't fetch remote fonts at import time (offline Illustrator, some Figma import paths, older SVG viewers) will substitute typography. The SVG renders correctly in any modern browser. For pixel-perfect portability, recommend the PNG export.

## PNG export procedure

Render **the original HTML** (not the extracted SVG) and capture only the `<svg>` at its `viewBox` dimensions. This keeps font loading reliable (already wired in the source HTML) while satisfying the "diagram only" rule. Use `omit_background=True` so browser-canvas transparency is preserved. A template that paints its own paper `<rect>` remains intentionally opaque; removing that rect would also break label masks and the authored palette. For motion-enabled HTML, append `?motion=static`, await `document.fonts.ready`, and assert the motion root has `data-frame="static"` before capture; never export at an arbitrary wall-clock delay.

### Detection

Use the packaged exporter relative to this loaded reference. Do not assume the skill is under the current project:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/export_png.py --check
```

The exporter searches in this order:

1. Python from `DIAGRAM_DESIGN_PYTHON`, the active interpreter, active virtual/Conda environments, project `.venv` or `venv`, then `python3` and `python` on `PATH`.
2. Playwright's managed Chromium.
3. The executable named by `DIAGRAM_DESIGN_CHROMIUM`.
4. Chrome, Chromium, or Edge found on `PATH` or in standard macOS, Linux, and Windows install locations.

When Playwright exists in another discovered Python environment, the exporter re-executes itself with that interpreter. It reports the selected Python and browser. It never installs or downloads dependencies.

If no Python Playwright installation is found, surface the exporter's interpreter-specific setup commands and stop. If Playwright is installed but no Chromium-family browser launches, surface its browser setup command and the `DIAGRAM_DESIGN_CHROMIUM` override. Do not replace those diagnostics with a generic import check.

### Rasterize

Run the packaged exporter:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/export_png.py <src.html> <out.png> --scale 2
```

The script opens the original HTML with `?motion=static`, waits for fonts, verifies the static motion frame when present, sizes the first `<svg>` to its `viewBox`, and screenshots it with a transparent background. It refuses the multi-diagram `assets/index.html` gallery and an SVG without valid `viewBox` dimensions.

Default `device_scale_factor=2` for crisp output. Accept any scale from `1` through `4`, including a fractional value computed for an exact target size.

### Output naming

`example-architecture.html` → `example-architecture.png`, written next to the source. Honour explicit user-provided paths.

## Sizing the export

The PNG's pixel dimensions are the SVG's `viewBox` × `device_scale_factor`. So the size decision was already made when the diagram was drawn — see [`output-spec.md` §2](output-spec.md) for the presets. Export only picks the multiplier.

| Destination | Scale | Result from a 1280×720 `viewBox` |
|---|---|---|
| Docs, README, wiki | 2 | 2560×1440 |
| Slide deck (projected) | 2 | 2560×1440 |
| Print / PDF handout | 3 | 3840×2160 |
| Inline thumbnail, email | 1 | 1280×720 |

### Hitting an exact pixel size

When the user needs specific dimensions (an OG card at exactly 1200×630, a slide image at 1920×1080), compute the scale factor instead of guessing — Playwright accepts fractional values:

```
scale = target_width / viewBox_width
```

A 960-wide `viewBox` at a 1200px target is `scale=1.25`. Two rules:

- **Never scale below 1** to hit a small target — that soft-focuses the type. Redraw at a smaller preset instead.
- **Never scale past 4** — beyond that you're upscaling a layout that was designed for a smaller canvas; redraw at `slide-16x9` or a print preset.

If the target aspect ratio doesn't match the `viewBox` aspect ratio, say so and offer to redraw at the matching preset. Padding or cropping a finished diagram to fit a frame is not an export operation — it breaks the 40px safe margin.

## Edge cases

- **Source is `assets/index.html`** (the gallery, multiple SVGs in one file): refuse the export and ask the user which specific diagram file they meant. Don't guess.
- **No `<svg>` block found**: the source isn't a diagram file. Tell the user; don't write anything.
- **Surrounding HTML matters to the user**: they want cards/header in the image. Tell them this skill exports diagrams only, and recommend a browser-based full-page screenshot (or a separate PDF print).
- **Source is missing fonts at runtime**: Playwright will substitute, the screenshot will look off. Check that the source HTML has the `<link href="...fonts.googleapis.com...">` tag in `<head>`. If absent, the file isn't from a current template — fix the source rather than working around it in export.

## What this command never does

- Modifies the source HTML.
- Adds export buttons or `<script>` tags. Static diagrams remain script-free; an already motion-enabled source may retain the scoped controller from [`animation.md`](animation.md), but export never injects another controller.
- Auto-emits `.svg` or `.png` alongside HTML generation. Manual on every call.
- Embeds an HTML wrapper (cards, headers) into the SVG via `foreignObject`. Too fragile across renderers.
